            and started to jump on the lion's body.Lion disturbed and opened his eyes.He grabbed the 
            mouse in his paws and said "Hey you naughty mouse you broked my sleep now I will eat you".
            The mouse said "Sorry mighty lion,please leave me I promise one day I will help you".
            The lion laughed "You a little mouse will help me, Ok let's see".And he leaved the mouse.
            One day a hunter came in the jungle he saw that the lion is sleeping so he putted the net on the
             lion and caught him.The lion roared and roared but no one came.Mouse heard the lion's roar
              and he thought that the lion must be in the trouble.He hurried up and when he came there he saw
               that the lion is covered with net.The mouse called his friends and started to cut the net by his
                mouths the all mouses cutted the net and made the lion free.The lion thanked mouse fr the help.
